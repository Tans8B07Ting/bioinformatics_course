# bioinformatics_course
## **this is my page for my bioinformatics course**  
### week 1 setup
- notes
  learned about the advantages and disadvantages of some system or languages,such as *linux*、*R*、*markdown*  
  learned about the differences between algorithm and model:
  
  - algorithm: The specific steps and computational methods to solve a problem. It's like a recipe that tells what to do first, what to do next.
  - model: A mathematical abstraction of a real-world problem. It contains parameters learned from data and represents a pattern or rule.  
  **We run algorithms to process data, and what we ultimately obtain is a model that can be used for prediction or analysis.**
- plan for the semester
  learn about bioinformatics to better process experiment data  
  learn about *R* to improve my analysis ability  
  process real data to test my skills  
  integrate AI into my analysis
